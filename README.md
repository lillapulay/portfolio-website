# portfolio-website

## About
Portfolio website that currently uses HTML and CSS.
I started building this website upon starting the CF Full-Stack Web Development course and I keep adding the projects I'm working on to the "Projects" page.

## Planned updates:
- new SVG animation
- navbar animation
- hamburger menu for small screens
