# Portfolio Website

## About
I started building this website when I began to study Web Development. Since I enjoy coding everything from scratch, I'm not in a hurry to incorporate too many libraries. For now, I only use a touch of jQuery for my contact form, but I'm never out of ideas and currently working on new updates.

## Planned updates:
- [x] Styling updates
- [x] New logo
- [x] Working contact form 
- [ ] Scrollbar styling
- [ ] New SVG animation - I'm still looking for a more relevant image that I like
- [ ] Navbar animation on big screens
- [ ] Hamburger menu for small screens
- [ ] Content update for 'About me'
- [ ] Adding my latest project (React Native chat app)
- [ ] Updating project descriptions (plus more images)
- [ ] (Possibly) "Scroller" resume
